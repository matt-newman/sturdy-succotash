## How will we assess your solution?

- Readability and how well-typed your code is
- The code should be written in Typescript and _must_ compile and run, on Node 18 or later.
- We take into account your previous experience with TypeScript.
- Don't implement anything unnecessary - i.e. authentication, database, containerization. We won't give additional credit for that.

## Description
 As a highly personalized service, communications to our customers must be tailored purr-fectly and personalized to each and every customer. As we have multiple channels of communications (i.e. emails, SMS, landing pages), we like to keep the templating logic for this channel-agnostic and in a dedicated REST API service.

 For example, calling `GET /comms/welcome-fresh/<USER-ID>` might return
```json
{
    "message": "Welcome to X, <full-name>! We're super excited for <cat1> and <cat2> to join the X club and start loving fresh!"
}
```
with the interpolated values populated with that specific customer's (and cat's) data. This endpoint could then be used to generate content for SMSs, emails, or personalized web pages.


## The setup
A skeletal backend has already been setting up for you, using TypeScript and NestJS - the language and framework we use at X. To run this backend, you can do `yarn start`.

There is no frontend setup - you are free to setup one of your own React-based one as you choose, either within the same repository or in a different repository.

There is a `data.json` file containing user data in this repository, which you should read from in place of a database.

## 1. The Backend Task

Within this codebase, create an endpoint `/comms/your-next-delivery/<USER-ID>`, that looks up the corresponding user's data, and returns a JSON payload of the following shape:

```JSON
{
    "title": "Your next delivery for <cat names, separated by comma or 'and'>",
    "message": "Hey <firstName>! In two days' time, we'll be charging you for your next order for <cat names, formatted as described below>'s fresh food.",
    "totalPrice": <total price, calculated via the formula shown in a later section in this README>,
    "freeGift": <true if the total price exceeds 120 pounds, otherwise false>
}
```

Cat names should be formatted in a grammatically correct manner, i.e. just `A` if there's a single cat named A, `A and B` if there's two cats, `A, B and C` if there's three or more cats.

For example, with the following user:

```JSON
{
  "id": "ff535484-6880-4653-b06e-89983ecf4ed5",
  "firstName": "Kayleigh",
  "lastName": "Wilderman",
  "email": "Kayleigh_Wilderman@hotmail.com",
  "cats": [
    {
      "name": "Dorian",
      "subscriptionActive": true,
      "breed": "Thai",
      "pouchSize": "C"
    },
    {
      "name": "Ocie",
      "subscriptionActive": true,
      "breed": "Somali",
      "pouchSize": "F"
    },
    {
      "name": "Eldridge",
      "subscriptionActive": false,
      "breed": "Himalayan",
      "pouchSize": "A"
    }
  ]
}
```
hitting `/comms/your-next-delivery/ff535484-6880-4653-b06e-89983ecf4ed5` should return the following body:
```JSON
{
    "title": "Your next delivery for Dorian and Ocie",
    "message": "Hey Kayleigh! In two days' time, we'll be charging you for your next order for Dorian and Ocie's fresh food.",
    "totalPrice": 134.00,
    "freeGift": true
}
```

### Price calculation

Cats come in different shapes and sizes. Bigger cats need more food, and vice versa. Our food is delivered in pouches, hence we use the term _pouch size_ to refer to how much food a cat needs. Therefore, every cat in the dataset will have a `pouchSize` attributed to them - between `A` to `F`. Every pouch size will have its own price.

A user's order price is there calculated as the sum of their _active_ cats' pouch size prices. The pouch size prices are described below:

```
A -> 55.50 GBP
B -> 59.50 GBP
C -> 62.75 GBP
D -> 66.00 GBP
E -> 69.00 GBP
F -> 71.25 GBP
```

So for example, if a user had 3 cats, each on pouch size A, B, C, but only the first two cats (on A and B) currently have an active subscription, then their price would be 55.50 + 59.50 = Â£115.00 pounds.


## 2. The Frontend Task

Using React (or your favourite React-based metaframework of choice), create a frontend with just one page - `/welcome/<USER-ID>`, which calls the API endpoint described in the previous step and renders the message in a style similar to the figma file provided [here](https://www.figma.com/design/b6Q7B8dBr6QbdqkhPNoFgD/Untitled?node-id=0-1).

You can:
  - Create a separate folder/repository to do this if you choose.
  - Use any libraries/frameworks you want, i.e. Tailwind, styled components (or not - feel free to just use regular styling/CSS as well).
  - Use any project generators you want (i.e. `create-next-app`, `create-react-app`, `create-vite-app`)

_Note_: We aren't expecting an exact 1-to-1 copy of the design, i.e. exact fonts, spacing, or colors. Just get roughly close enough. __Use any random image of a cat__ that you can find.
