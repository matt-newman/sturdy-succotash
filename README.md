# TODO: 
We would also appreciate it if you can write a sentence or two about what you think of this test and/or and how we could improve it.

## Getting started:

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

In another terminal run the tests:
```
yarn test
```

obvviously feel free to inspect the tests and the commit history shows there's some light TDD, to demonstrate understanding

The endpoints are e.g:
* [localhost:3000/comms/your-next-delivery/](http://localhost:3000/comms/your-next-delivery/3dfdc5cf-b8ed-40f7-a5ca-5e88ad103b60)
* [localhost:3000/user/](http://localhost:3000/user/3dfdc5cf-b8ed-40f7-a5ca-5e88ad103b60)

Using the following IDs you should be able to get data back from the endpoints:

```
3dfdc5cf-b8ed-40f7-a5ca-5e88ad103b60
ff535484-6880-4653-b06e-89983ecf4ed5
```

### What next...
spin up the other project, which is a super basic NextJS UI using this backend
